Readme for bcalc

bcalc is developed to be a multi ui simplistic RPN calculator.

installation note:
  the configure script is able to enable/disable ui's, the exception is
  the text ui.
  see ./configure --help for more information.

  if readline-ui is included it will be default, if not text-ui will.

Operands:
  +,-   normal
  *,/   -""-
  !     faculty (requires only one element)
  ^     powers
  sqrt  square root
  %     mod

Commands: (in bcalc)
  p   print top value
  s   print stack
  d   delete top value
  q   quit
  c   clear stack
  a   repeats last operation on all the stack
  i   invert multiplies top value with -1
  h   prints a little help text

available interfaces:
  text     - just a text interface (printf etc).
  curses   - a curses based ui
  readline - readline input else as text
  gtk2     - GTK 2.x based ui

Notes:
  ',' and '.' are handled the same way.

  Since v0.2.3 spaces both:
    55
    66
    +

  and:
    55 66 +

  are valid input methods.
